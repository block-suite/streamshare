StreamShare for Twitch is the best way to share your Twitch content with the world.

== Description ==
StreamShare for Twitch allows you to quickly and easily embed your content using blocks.

We support the embedding of:

* Livestreams: [https://www.twitch.tv/backlogathon/](https://www.twitch.tv/backlogathon/)
* Videos: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510127216](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510127216)
* Clips: [https://www.twitch.tv/backlogathon/clip/BenevolentWimpyRabbitPhilosoraptor](https://www.twitch.tv/backlogathon/clip/BenevolentWimpyRabbitPhilosoraptor) 
* Collections: [https://www.twitch.tv/collections/VNsQ6mVT2BWRPg](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/VNsQ6mVT2BWRPg)
* Videos from collections: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510127216?collection=VNsQ6mVT2BWRPg](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510127216?collection=VNsQ6mVT2BWRPg)

You don't even need to add the Twitch block. Just paste a Twitch link into a paragraph block and we'll do the rest.
