# StreamShare

StreamShare for Twitch allows you to quickly and easily embed your content using blocks.

We support the embedding of:

* Livestreams: https://www.twitch.tv/backlogathon/
* Videos: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510127216
* Clips: https://www.twitch.tv/backlogathon/clip/BenevolentWimpyRabbitPhilosoraptor
* Collections: https://www.twitch.tv/collections/VNsQ6mVT2BWRPg
* Videos from collections: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510127216?collection=VNsQ6mVT2BWRPg

You don't even need to add the Twitch block. Just paste a Twitch link into a paragraph block and we'll do the rest.
